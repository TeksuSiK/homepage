                    Hi, I’m Oskar from Poland, and I’ve been programming as a
                    hobby for about five years. For the past few months, I’ve
                    been working as a QA Engineer at a software house, where I
                    focus on ensuring the quality of software while continuing
                    to expand my technical expertise. I’m especially passionate
                    about backend technologies and server administration, and
                    I’m always eager to learn more in these areas.

                    Alongside my job, I’m a student at a technical university,
                    where I’m honing my skills in computer science and software
                    development. I enjoy taking on new challenges and constantly
                    improving my abilities.
