## Hello

Hi, I'm Oskar. I am a backend developer, but I also try the frontend. I started programming in 2018, writing plugins for Minecraft servers. Sometimes I play games, mostly Valorant and Minecraft.

Currently, my primary programming language is Java, in which I use technologies such as Spring Boot, Spigot and Paper API. I know the basics of Python and Rust. I also deal with the administration of Linux and Windows servers, databases and Docker containers.

I am looking for projects that I can join in order to gain new experiences. You can contact me via [**Discord**](https://discord.com/users/407107019984732181), [**GitHub**](https://github.com/teksusik) or [**e-mail**](mailto:oskar@teksusik.pl).
